This fork adds support for compiz's viewports.
Just add `taskbar_mode = viewports` to your config file and it will only show windows within the current viewport on the taskbar.

The code is hacky and it's heavily based on the patch by Mendes from here https://code.google.com/p/tint2/issues/detail?id=286

But it works. Tint2 + Desktop Cube ftw!
